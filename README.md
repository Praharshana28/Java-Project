Project Title:
Student Management System

Project Overview:
This project is a simple console-based Java application that helps manage student information such as ID, name, and age. It allows users to add student records, display all stored students, and exit the program. The project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, constructors, and methods.

Features:

Add new student details (ID, Name, Age)

View all existing student records

Simple text-based menu for easy navigation

Uses ArrayList for dynamic data storage

Project Structure:

StudentManagement.java â€“ The main file containing all logic and the Student class

Technologies Used:

Java (Core Java concepts)

OOP principles (Class, Object, Constructor, Method)

ArrayList for storing data dynamically

How to Run the Project:

Install Java JDK on your system.

Save the code as StudentManagement.java.

Open Command Prompt or Terminal and navigate to the file directory.

Compile the code using:

javac StudentManagement.java


Run the program using:

java StudentManagement


Follow the on-screen menu to add or view students.

Learning Highlights:

Hands-on understanding of classes and objects in Java

Use of collections (ArrayList) for data management

Implementation of console input and output with Scanner

Simple menu-driven programming logic

Future Enhancements:

Add options to update and delete student records

Store data in files or databases (JDBC integration)

Create a GUI using JavaFX or Swing

Add student grades and report generation
